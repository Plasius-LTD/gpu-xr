## What this project does

`@plasius/gpu-xr` provides framework-agnostic WebXR runtime/session management:

- XR mode support probing for immersive VR/AR.
- Session request and lifecycle management with merged feature policies.
- A framework-neutral session state store for UI/runtime integration.
- APIs intended to pair with non-Three.js GPU rendering stacks.

---

## Getting started (local dev)

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 24 (see `.nvmrc`).
- A browser with WebGPU support for demo validation.

### Install

```sh
npm ci
```

### Build

```sh
npm run build
```

### Test

```sh
npm test
```

## How to propose a change

### 1) For bugs

- Search existing issues first.
- Open a new issue with repro steps, expected vs actual behavior, and environment details.

### 2) For features / refactors

- Open an issue first for non-trivial changes.
- If the change affects architecture or public APIs, add a new ADR in `docs/adrs/`.

### 3) Pull Requests

- Keep PRs focused.
- Add/update tests.
- Update docs (README, ADRs, CHANGELOG) when behavior changes.

## Branch, commit, PR

**Branching**

- Create a feature branch from `main`: `feat/xyz` or `fix/abc`.

**Commit messages**

Use Conventional Commits, e.g.:

- `feat: add immersive-ar session capability checks`
- `fix: validate unknown profile names`
- `docs: add ADR for session lifecycle policy`
- `test: add technique manifest coverage`

---

## Coding standards

- Language: JavaScript.
- Keep APIs runtime-agnostic and browser-native where possible.
- Prefer API stability and SemVer-safe additions.
- Keep runtime dependencies minimal.

---

## Documentation

- Update `README.md` for new APIs and workflows.
- Add a new ADR (do not rewrite accepted ADR history) for architectural changes.
